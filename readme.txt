This is a clean app template starting point.

I have modified the woo commerce .ts file with working api calls to our live website.

I have also modified the detail container to send a working api call to our website by adding a "?" to the api call on line 42 of detail.container.tsx

I recloned from https://github.com/iksena/RNWCShop just to have a safe starting point as reference in case anything breaks in development.
